Aiit um..... i had an idea of a project from SoloLearn

its just to create a image in a div with a transform:scale(); effect and a transparent border on hover effect such that
1. on hover, it's border becomes tranparent and its size increases gradually using the transform:scale(); styling

might seem simple to some... Buh its a start!!
